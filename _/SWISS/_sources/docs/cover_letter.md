# Cover Letter

```{epigraph}
_The symbol of all relationships among men, the moral symbol of respect for human beings, is the trader. We, who live by values, not by loot, are traders, both in matter and in spirit. A trader is a man who earns what he gets and does not give or take the undeserved._

-- _Ayn Rand_

Dear Sir or Madam

As a skilled and experienced professional in the field of transport planning and data science, 
I am writing to express my interest and demonstrate my motivation (partly summarized by the quote above - support _airborne_ trade) to fulfill the position as 
Cargo Business Research Analytics & Pricing at SWISS.
After several years of experience working in interdisciplinary teams, between analytics and business requirements, 
I'm confident that I would prove a valuable addition to your team. 

Working with transportation planning for several years now, I gathered valuable multidisciplinary experience, taking me much beyond my initial studies in Logistics and Transportation Engineering.
Within this field I accumulated hands-on experience with all things (transportation) data, from the development of statistical models, demand analyses, custom dashboards and reports to setting up a machine learning model on cloud infrastructure. The latter was the output of a project I led, with 3 other colleagues in my team. I believe this wide range of experiences could be of great value to your requirements regarding the development data-driven tools and reports.

Personally I enjoy working in teams and look up to business challenges that can be solved with data-driven approaches. 
You'll find me always motivated by new projects and willing to take responsibility 
when it comes to developing new ways of adding value to the organisation. 

Please take your time to review my application for further details. 
I'll be delighted to discuss them in person with you.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,

Davi Guggisberg Bicudo
