# Cover Letter

```{epigraph}
_Money demands that you sell, not your weakness to men’s stupidity, 
but your talent to their reason; it demands that you buy, not the 
shoddiest they offer, but the best that your money can find. 
And when men live by trade–with reason, not force, as their final arbiter
–it is the best product that wins, the best performance, the man of 
best judgment and highest ability–and the degree of a man’s 
productiveness is the degree of his reward. 
This is the code of existence whose tool and symbol is money._

-- _Ayn Rand_

Dear Sir or Madam

As a skilled and experienced data analytics professional, I am writing to express my interest
and demonstrate my motivation to fulfill the position as Data Scientist/Analyst at the Credit Suisse. 
After several years of experience working in interdisciplinary R&D teams, with complex and data-intensive models, 
I'm confident that I would prove a valuable addition to your team. 

Fascinated from the beginning with complex mathematical problems, I started my career working 
with transportation models. 
Within this field I gathered valuable hands-on experience with all things data,
from the development of statistical and complex simulation models, to setting up a machine learning model on cloud infrastructure. The latter was the output of a project I led, with 3 other colleagues in my team. 

I find Deep Learning particularly fascinating and would be excited to apply and expand my knowledge of it at the Credit Suisse.
During my CAS in Applied Data Science I coded a neural network by hand, i.e. including gradient descent, back propagation and all matrix operations (code available at [NeuralNetDIY](https://github.com/davibicudo/NeuralNetDIY)). 
In another project in the same CAS I used PyTorch to train a Graph Neural Network. 

Personally I enjoy working in teams and finding peers to exchange ideas and learn from. 
You'll find me always motivated by complex problems and willing to take responsibility 
when it comes to developing innovative ways of adding value to the organisation. 

Please take your time to review my application for further details. 
I'll be delighted to discuss them in person with you.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,

Davi Guggisberg Bicudo
